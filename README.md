## Vision

EduOS is being built as the **foundational infrastructure** for modern, personalized, and institutionally trusted education — connecting children, parents, elite tutors, schools, universities, and future employers in one secure, AI-powered ecosystem.

Think:  
**Netflix × Harvard × Private Concierge Tutors × Family Intelligence Center × AI Governance**

This is not another learning platform.  
This is the **operating system** for generational human capital development.
